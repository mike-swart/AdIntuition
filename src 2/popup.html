		<p>This Browser Extension will help you determine when there is a relationship between a YouTube content creator and advertiser. These relationships are determined through the presence of <b>Affiliate Marketing Links</b>, which trace the source of traffic to a web page and, if products are purchased, the YouTube content creator that brought you there earns a commission. Though affiliated marketing is not always bad, it is important to realize when a video is sponsored in order to form a full opinion about the content of the video.</p>
		<p>Known <span style='background-color:#fccdd3'>affiliate links</span> are highlighted in red</p>
		<p>Suspected <span style='background-color:#fce0ce'>affiliate links</span> are highlighted in orange</p>
		<p>Suspected <span style='background-color:#fcefce'>coupon codes</span> are highlighted in yellow</p>
		<p>When you load a Youtube video, this extension will alert you in your preferred format (configured through your settings) if the video contains sponsored content.</p>
