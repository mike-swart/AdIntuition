# AdIntuition
A Browser Extension to detect and disclose affiliate marketing content

### Using the extension
Steps to test the extension while it is still being developed:
* Go to `chrome://extensions`
* Toggle `developer mode` on in the upper right hand corner
* Click `Load Unpacked` and then select the `src` folder in this directory

### Research Question
How successfully can we show that there are advertisements on a social media platform? We will be focusing on YouTube, but the methods that we use will be possible to extend onto other platforms. What is the best way to display this data so that users can understand that the content creator is benefitting from the post?
